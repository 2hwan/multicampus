[Intro]
Billie

[Chorus]
What do you want from me?
Why don’t you run from me?
What are you wondering?
What do you know?

Why aren’t you scared of me?
Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1]
(Come here)
Say it, spit it out
What is it exactly?
Your pain is the amount
Cleaning you out
Am I satisfactory?

Today I’m thinking about
The things that are deadly
The way I’m drinking you down
Like I wanna drown
Like I wanna end me

[Bridge]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue
Bury a friend, try to wake up
Cannibal class, killing the son
Bury a friend

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

[Chorus]
What do you want from me?
Why don’t you run from me?
What are you wondering?
What do you know?

Why aren’t you scared of me?
Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 2]
(Listen)
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star and get you connected?
I’ll meet you in the park, I’ll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start
That you’d fall apart ’cause I’m too expensive

You talk about something that shouldn’t be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keeping my head hold down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Verse 3]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
‘Cause I can’t say no, no, I can’t say no
And my limbs are frozen, my eyes won’t close
And I can’t say no, I can’t say no
Careful

[Bridge]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue
Bury a friend, try to wake up
Cannibal class, killing the son
Bury a friend

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me
I wann,a I wanna, I wanna

[Chorus]
What do you want from me?
Why don’t you run from me?
What are you wondering?
What do you know?

Why aren’t you scared of me?
Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
